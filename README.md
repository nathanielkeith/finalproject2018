Finalproject2018:

The objective of this code is take a featureclass and an excel file and join them to extract necessary updates to the featureclass. These updates are performed weekly. 

This code is currently under edit. As of 12/10/2018 The code only uses a hardcoded featureclass and excel file to perform the task. It is currently being edited to prompt for certain things to make this tool very flexible in use for other situations. The major addition will be changing the hardcoded concatenation. I want it to receive and process the data up to the concatenation portion and provide a callout list for a custom concatenation. I am also prompting custom naming scheme and file location for prompted files verses hardcoded files it currently uses. 

Getting Started:

To get started you will need a copy of the Timber Marking Shapefile and Timber markings excel file. New files and naming scheme will change at the beginning of each year. 

Prerequisites:

You will need to install ArcGIS Desktop 10.x or better 

Deployment:

This can be deployed using ArcGIS Desktop or ArcGIS Pro. My preference is in ArcCatalog 

Built With:
      •	IDLE – Python Environment
      •	ArcGIS – Code from tools and tool packages

Versioning:

I used GitHub for versioning.

Authors:
      •	Nathaniel Keith – All tool and code work
